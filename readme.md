# Code_refactor 


# Overview

The purpose of this project is to  make my website more accessible. I want to use "dry" principle of coding 
to make the code clean and hence making the website optimised for search engines.

# Steps to acheive the goal

1. By using Semanctic html tags like <header>, <footer>, <section>, <aside> ,<figure> in place of <div>

2. Adding a suitable title for the webpage

3. Adding comments to the html for improved accessibilty and understanding of code.

4. In Css we have removed the repititive blocks of code and merged them to perform the same styling with fewer code lines

5. We have added comments in Css to improve accessibility.
